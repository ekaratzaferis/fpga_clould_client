   instantiating a CORE Generator module in a VHDL design.

fil1.xco:
   CORE Generator input file containing the parameters used to
   regenerate a core.

fil1_cic_compiler_v1_2_xst_1.ngc_xst.xrpt:
   Please see the core data sheet.

fil1_flist.txt:
   Text file listing all of the output files produced when a customized
   core was generated in the CORE Generator.

fil1_readme.txt:
   Text file indicating the files generated and how they are used.

fil1_xmdf.tcl:
   ISE Project Navigator interface file. ISE uses this file to determine
   how the files output by CORE Generator for the core can be integrated
   into your ISE project.
